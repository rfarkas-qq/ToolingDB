**Project Goal:** To create a professional asset management application, similar to Maximo, for tracking and maintaining foam tools used in production.

This application will provide a "lovable" (clean, intuitive, and reliable) interface for managing the location, status, and parameters of all core production assets.

**Core Assets to Track:**
* **Tools:** The primary foam tools used to create parts.
* **Carriers:** Mounts that hold 1-6 tools for use on the production line.
* **Modificators:** Inserts that alter a tool to produce a different part.
* **Cavities:** The individual part-forming sections within a tool.
